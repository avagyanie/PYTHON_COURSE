"""
Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky 
if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.

Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not.

Example

    For n = 1230, the output should be
    solution(n) = true;
    For n = 239017, the output should be
    solution(n) = false.

Input/Output

    [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

    [input] integer n

    A ticket number represented as a positive integer with an even number of digits.

    Guaranteed constraints:
    10 â‰¤ n < 106.

    [output] boolean

    true if n is a lucky ticket number, false otherwise.
