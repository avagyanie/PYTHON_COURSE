"""
The caret ^, when found at the start of a character set, is the equivalent to "not" in RegEx. 
The regular expression [^a-c] matches any characters except "a", "b" and "c". Write the regular 
expression that matches any characters except letters, digits and spaces. You must use a negated 
character set in your expression.
Examples
txt = " alice15@gmail.com "
pattern = "yourregularexpressionhere"

re.findall(pattern, txt) âžž ["@", "."]

Notes

    You don't need to write a function, just the pattern.
    Do not remove import re from the code.
    Find more info on RegEx and negation in Resources.
    You can find all the challenges of this series in my Basic RegEx collection.
