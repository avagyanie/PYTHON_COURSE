"""
Given a lottery ticket (ticket), represented by a list of 2-value lists, create a function to find out if 
you've won the jackpot.

To do this, you must first count the "mini-wins" on your ticket. Each sublist has both a string and a number 
within it. If the character code of any of the characters in the string matches the number, you get a mini-win. 
Note you can only have one mini-win per sublist.

Once you have counted all of your mini-wins, compare that number to the other input provided (win). If your 
number of mini-wins is more than or equal to win, return Winner!. Else, return Loser!.
Examples

lottery([["YYW", 70], ["WXK", 65], ["RPDI", 88]], 2)
➞ "Loser!"

lottery([["KG", 80], ["NTBBVZ", 79], ["CI", 73], ["AGXMEE", 74], ["IU", 68], ["VOSP" , 84]], 1)
➞ "Winner!"

lottery([["ZSAMZB", 81], ["XWWCXP", 72], ["SYBRQOHP", 88], ["HJSVV", 75]], 1)
➞ "Loser!"

Notes

    All inputs will be in the correct format.
    Strings on ticket are not always the same length.
